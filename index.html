            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are the building blocks of computer science. They are essential for writing efficient and scalable code.</p>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Array</h2>
            <p>Array is a collection of similar data types. It is a linear data structure that stores elements in a contiguous memory location.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Linked List</h2>
            <p>Linked List is a linear data structure. It is a collection of nodes where each node consists of a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Stack</h2>
            <p>Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. It has two main operations: push and pop.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Queue</h2>
            <p>Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. It has two main operations: enqueue and dequeue.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Tree</h2>
            <p>Tree is a non-linear data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. It is used to represent hierarchical relationships.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Graph</h2>
            <p>Graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of vertices (nodes) connected by edges. It is used to represent networks.</p>
